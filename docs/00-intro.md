# What Is JAQ Stack?
JAQ Stack (pronounced "jack stack") is a Rapid Application Development (RAD) archetype that combines three proven technologies into a single, cohesive blueprint:

- **J** = Java (via Helidon SE – lightweight, cloud-native)
- **A** = Angular (modern, full-featured frontend)
- **Q** = (No)SQL (default: MongoDB – flexible, developer-friendly) - representing your data layer, whether SQL or NoSQL. 

Born from over a decade of real-world development pain, JAQ eliminates boilerplate so you can go from idea to production in hours, not weeks.

## Why JAQ?
Most developers waste time on:

- Wiring backend + frontend + database
- Configuring auth, CORS, logging, and health checks
- Setting up consistent project structures across teams
- Building repeatable deployment pipelines

JAQ solves this by providing a pre-integrated, opinionated stack with:

- Standardized project layout
- Production-ready defaults
- Built-in testing and observability
- A clear path to AI integration

## Overall Architecture

- **Frontend**: Angular application with built-in routing and state management
- **Backend**: Helidon SE microservice exposing RESTful APIs
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible, schema-less data storage
- **Integration**: Type-safe contracts, shared validation rules, and unified error handling

All layers are designed to work together from day one—no glue code required.
