## The Story Behind JAQ Stack
{{% /blocks/lead %}}

{{% blocks/section %}}
JAQ Stack was born out of frustration. As a developer, I found myself repeatedly setting up three separate tech stacks and boilerplate code for every new project. The tedious process was slowing me down and taking away from the excitement of building something new.

A Solution Born of Necessity
I decided to take matters into my own hands and create a unified tech stack that combined the best of Java, JavaScript, and NoSQL. After countless hours of experimentation and iteration, JAQ Stack was born.
