- ⚙️ **Free autobuilds** for automatic image publishing  
- 🚀 **Rate-limit removal** for all users pulling JAQ Stack public images

## 💡 Why It Matters

This sponsorship allows us to:

- Keep our **Helidon / Angular / SQL-NoSQL** containers freely available  
- Deliver **faster, more reliable builds** for the community  
- Enhance **security and transparency** through Docker Scout integration  
- Maintain **open, rate-limit-free access** for developers everywhere  

It’s another step toward our mission — **making full-stack development faster, simpler, and open for everyone.**

## 🧭 Our Commitment

JAQ Stack will continue to embody its founding principles:

- 🆓 **Open Source** — MIT-licensed and freely available  
- 🤝 **Community-Driven** — guided by your ideas and contributions  
- 🔍 **Transparent Development** — open discussions, roadmap, and feedback  

With Docker’s support, we’re even better positioned to maintain consistent, reliable builds and grow our open-source ecosystem.
